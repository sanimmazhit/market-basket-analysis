\section{Dataset Description}
We used the \textbf{Amazon Books Review} dataset published on Kaggle. The dataset contains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Books\_rating.csv} – includes reviews with fields like \texttt{review/text}.
    \item \texttt{books\_data.csv} – includes metadata like \texttt{User\_id}, \texttt{Title}, and ratings.
\end{itemize}

For our analysis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For word-based baskets: we used the \texttt{review/text} column.
    \item For book-based baskets: we used \texttt{User\_id} and \texttt{Title}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Preprocessing}
\subsection*{Text Reviews}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dropped duplicates and missing reviews.
    \item Filtered reviews to keep only those with 10–100 words.
    \item Cleaned the text: lowercased, removed punctuation, stopwords, and kept only common words.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Book-User Data}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Selected only \texttt{User\_id} and \texttt{Title}.
    \item Filtered out users with only one book reviewed.
    \item Grouped book baskets by user.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
We used the \texttt{mlxtend} Python library to apply the Apriori algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Minimum support: 0.01
    \item Minimum confidence: 0.3
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Results}
\subsection*{Top Frequent Word Pairs}

\section{Scalability}
To ensure scalability:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We used \texttt{mlxtend}, which is optimized for large binary datasets.
    \item Used subsampling (1\%) during development to avoid Colab memory crashes.
    \item The approach is easily scalable by adjusting the sampling rate or chunking the dataset.
\end{itemize}

\section{Reflection}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Word baskets often cluster around sentiment or themes (e.g., “book, read”, “book, great”).
    \item Book baskets reveal user reading patterns, showing strong clustering around popular titles.
\end{itemize}
